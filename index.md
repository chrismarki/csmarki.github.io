## Welcome to CsMarki's page

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/csmarki/csmarki.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Projects

I'll update this page every once in a while with projects with a defined scope and deadline. 

```markdown
# Project 1: Create a hangman 

Scope: Create Hangman with error handling
Deadline: One week 
Tech: Python Command prompts

## Day 1

Scope work:
- Understand how Hangman works
   ### Rules
    1. Using 26 letters of the Alphabet, pick one letter at a time to guess the randomized target word.
    2. Choosing a letter not in the target word will build the hang man in ASCII art 
    3. The number of letters will be revealed at the start as underscores (_)
    4. Correctly chosen letters will be revealed on the Hangman
  
 
**Action Items**
 -Get a word bank
 -Develop system of submitting guesses and checking against word bank / Error handling
 -Implement ASCII Art per guess 
 -Develop Restarting/Game Over 

Day 1
-Established the word bank, submitting guesses/error handling 

Day 4 
-Drew the ASCII art based on the guesses submitted

Day 7 
-Finished the game. It's day seven but the total elapsed time was much shorter to develop. So I'm happy I was able to develop it within scope.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/csmarki/csmarki.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
